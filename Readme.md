# Remq

Remq (pronounced 'rem-que') is a set of [Redis](http://redis.io) Lua scripts
enabling Redis to function as a durable message queue/topic broker for fast,
reliable inter-service communication. These scripts, along with some simple
client libraries make it easy to build fast, durable message channels with
minimal infrastructure requirements.

**How it works**:

  - Producers publish messages to a channel and receive unique message-ids
  - Consumers subscribe to message channels via Redis pub/sub for fast delivery
  - Subscribe to multiple channels at once using globbing (ie. `'events.*'`)
  - Replay missed messages from a given message-id for recovery after consumer failure
  - Messages are garanteed to be received in-order when consumers use ids properly
  - Able to sustain ~35k messages/sec on loopback interface (1 producer -> 1 consumer)
  - Consistent performance up to memory limit (tested to ~25m messages in 4GB memory)
  - Channels may be flushed of old messages periodically to reduce memory footprint

**WARNING**: In early-stage development, API not stable. If you've used a previous
version of these scripts, you'll most likely have to clear all previously
published messages in order to upgrade to the latest version.

## Client Libraries

- Node.js: [remq-node](https://github.com/kainosnoema/remq-node) (`npm install remq`)
- Ruby: [remq-rb](https://github.com/kainosnoema/remq-rb) (`gem install remq`)

## Usage

This project includes just the core Lua scripts that define the Remq protocol.
To use Remq to build a message queue, install Redis along a client library.

Redis protocol:

**Producer:**
``` sh
redis> EVAL <publish.lua> 0 <channel> <message>
# returns a unique message-id
```

**Consumer:**
``` sh
redis> PSUBSCRIBE remq:channel:<pattern>
# messages are published in the format "<channel>@<id>\n<message>"
```
or
``` sh
redis> EVAL <consume.lua> 0 <pattern> <cursor> <limit>
# messages are returned in the format "<channel>@<id>\n<message>"
```

**Flush:**
``` sh
redis> EVAL <flush.lua> 0 <pattern> <before-message-id>
# returns the count of messages flushed
```
